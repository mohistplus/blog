Dear my friend:

That is a terrific chance to re recommend you a movie during this boring lockdown over coronavirus.

One of my favorite movies is Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan in 2014.

There are numrous reasons that you must take a look, in short, 3 of them.

First of all, a great direct, Christopher Nolan. A lot of famous movie by Christopher Nolan, like Memento, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises.

In addtion, a great science fiction film. At the doomed earth, people launched 12 rockets to space for a new earth. Interstellar included 3 popular phrases: time dilation effect, black hole, multidimensional space-time.

Finally, tremendous science fiction scences.I know you won't miss it.

Best wishes,

Yours Li Ming
