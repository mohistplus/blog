Less Garbage More voyage

You can find out an uncivilized behavior In this drawing. A couple of lovers are boating on the lake that girl throwing garbage away at the same time. When the boat sailed away, left trashes floating on the water. Plastic bag and bottles , paper, tin cans... all of those trashes floating on the water. Near the girl, the boy is blind to the terrible thing and reading the paper.

There is no doubt that throwing garbage away is immoral behavior. What this thought-provoking drawing mirrors is the phenomenon that the environment of tourist areas is polluted by tourists. Many tourist areas suffer from a litter problem. Litter in tourist areas spoils the view, pollutes the environment, and takes times and money to clean up.

In view of all the harmful influences of toursts pollution, I think it is high time that we took measures to tackle the problem. To begin with, we should raise public awareness of tourism environmental protection. In addition, the administration of the tourist agencies should take legal measures to find those vistors who damage cultural relics, as only in this way can we solve the problem of tourist pollution and leave the beautiful sights to other visters.
